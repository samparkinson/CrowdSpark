## Project Description
In project management, crowd funding is a practice for covering runaround costs, it is a branch of crowd sourcing, where online contributors help a project. Our system looks at a similar problem namely crowd sourcing of very particular talents for projects and hobbies, which should have a positive influence on project success rates.

## Purpose of the System
The purpose of the system is to make it easier for people with peculiar hobbies or initiatives to join in groups and succeed with their common goals. We want to allow all sorts of groups ranging from musicians looking for a new guitarist to Arduino hobbyists looking for some sparring.
We intend to create a web based project organizing tool with social features. New users assign themselves some skills, upon which they get existing project recommendations for and follow them if interested. Users then can join **spark** these projects later on or right away. Users can also create whole new projects. Sparking behaves like a friend request on Facebook. Once a project owner approves of a spark, the requester can start contributing to the project.
